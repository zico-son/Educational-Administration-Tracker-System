# Educational Administration Tracker System (Backend)

## üåü Overview
A platform designed to assist educational institutions in managing, tracking, and evaluating the performance of their individual departments. The system not only tracks performance but also provides feedback in the form of scores, remarks, and mechanisms to address highlighted concerns.

## ‚ùó Problem Definition
Traditional educational administration often relies on manual record-keeping, paper-driven feedback systems, and non-centralized data. This leads to:
- Mismanagement of records.
- Inefficiencies in feedback and performance evaluation.
- Difficulty in monitoring departmental progress and performance.
- Challenges in addressing and tracking resolutions to identified problems.

The Educational Administration Tracker System aims to streamline these processes, offering a centralized, digital solution to manage, evaluate, and improve the performance of individual departments within educational institutions.
